Identifying a new object, color change of existing object, orientation change of existing object in a video using deep learning



To tackle the task of identifying a new object, color changes, and orientation changes in a video using deep learning, you can approach it as a combination of object detection, tracking, and change detection. Here's a structured way to achieve this:

1. Object Detection
Goal: Identify objects in each frame of the video.
Approach: Use a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or Detectron2) to detect objects.
Fine-tune the model on your dataset if the objects are domain-specific.
Output:
Bounding boxes and class labels for objects in each frame.


2. Object Tracking
Goal: Track detected objects across frames to maintain their identities.
Approach: Use a tracking algorithm such as DeepSORT or ByteTrack.
This will link detections across frames, assigning a unique ID to each detected object.


3. Color Change Detection
Goal: Detect if the color of an object changes over time.
Approach: Extract the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the detected object.
Use a color histogram or average RGB values to analyze changes over time.
Use a threshold or ML model to decide if the change is significant.


4. Orientation Change Detection
Goal: Detect if the orientation of an object changes over time.
Approach: Calculate keypoints and features using algorithms like ORB, SIFT, or a pre-trained neural network (e.g., OpenPose for human pose or keypoints from deep models like Mask R-CNN). Measure angular differences or spatial transformations across frames using geometric transformations (e.g., rotation matrix). Train a deep learning model if orientation-specific changes need domain-specific understanding.



5. New Object Detection
Goal: Identify when a new object appears in the scene.
Approach:
Compare detected objects' bounding boxes and labels across frames.
If an object with a new class or previously unseen ID appears, classify it as new.
Maintain a buffer to account for false positives or missed detections in single frames.

6. Pipeline Integration
Combine all tasks into a cohesive pipeline:
Run object detection on each frame.
Perform tracking to maintain object continuity.
Analyze detected objects for color or orientation changes using extracted ROIs and features.
Check for new objects by comparing the current frame's detected objects with previously tracked objects.

7. Deep Learning Models
Object Detection:YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, Detectron2
Color Change Detection: A CNN-based image classifier trained to distinguish different colors if needed.
Orientation Change Detection: Vision Transformers (ViT), ResNet, or custom CNNs for more complex scenarios.
Tracking: DeepSORT, ByteTrack
New Object Identification: Maintain a set of known objects and compare with current frame detections.

8. Data Preparation
Label data with: Object class and bounding boxes, Color states.
Orientation annotations if needed.

Create a video dataset with scenarios showcasing:
[1] New object appearances.
[2] Gradual and abrupt color changes.

9. Evaluation Metrics
Object Detection: mAP (mean Average Precision).
Tracking: MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy), MOTP (Precision).
Change Detection: Precision, Recall, and F1-score for change events.
