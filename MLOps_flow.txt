## Overview
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that aim to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. This document serves as a guideline for setting up a robust MLOps pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Extraction
- **Goal:** Acquire data from various sources for model training.
- **Steps:**
  - Identify data sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.).
  - Use data ingestion tools/scripts to extract raw data.
  - Validate data integrity and format.
- **Tools:** Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, Python scripts, SQL.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Goal:** Clean and prepare the data for model training.
- **Steps:**
  - Handle missing values.
  - Normalize/scale numerical features.
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Tools:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Goal:** Understand the data and identify patterns.
- **Steps:**
  - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
  - Detect outliers and anomalies.
  - Generate descriptive statistics.
- **Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

### 4. Model Development
- **Goal:** Build and train machine learning models.
- **Steps:**
  - Define the problem statement and evaluation metrics.
  - Select model architecture (e.g., decision trees, neural networks).
  - Train models on training data.
  - Optimize hyperparameters.
- **Tools:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Optuna.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Goal:** Assess model performance and choose the best model.
- **Steps:**
  - Evaluate models on validation and test sets.
  - Generate evaluation reports (e.g., confusion matrices, ROC curves).
  - Compare models using selected metrics.
- **Tools:** scikit-learn, TensorBoard.

### 6. Model Deployment
- **Goal:** Make the model available for production use.
- **Steps:**
  - Package the model with dependencies (e.g., Docker containers).
  - Deploy to cloud or on-prem servers.
  - Set up APIs or batch processing pipelines.
- **Tools:** Flask, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS SageMaker.

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Goal:** Ensure the deployed model performs reliably in production.
- **Steps:**
  - Monitor model performance and data drift.
  - Retrain the model periodically.
  - Log predictions and errors.
- **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow.

## Tools and Frameworks
Here are some commonly used tools for each stage:

| Stage                | Tools/Frameworks                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction      | Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, Python scripts         |
| Data Preprocessing   | pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn                      |
| EDA                  | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly                      |
| Model Development    | TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Optuna        |
| Model Deployment     | Flask, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS SageMaker        |
| Monitoring           | Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow                      |

## Best Practices
1. **Version Control:** Use Git to track changes in code, data, and model versions.
2. **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks using CI/CD pipelines.
3. **Reproducibility:** Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to ensure consistent environments.
4. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for each stage of the pipeline.
5. **Security:** Secure sensitive data and API keys using vaults or environment variables.
6. **Collaboration:** Foster team collaboration using platforms like GitHub, Jira, or Slack.
